# Coding Exercise

## Running

Written and tested using Node 14, but should work on Node 12 as well. Only dependency is for testing so no need to npm install unless you will be running tests *see below*

```
npm start
```

## Tests

Tests for the major library methods (getNeighbors and evolve) exist in lib.test.js. To run first install the dependencies (jest) and then run npm test.

```
npm install
npm test
```
